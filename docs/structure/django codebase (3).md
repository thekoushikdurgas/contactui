# django codebase

Once you let me know which of these best fits your needs, I can:

- **Create a production-ready starter template** with best practices for your specific use case
- **Generate architecture diagrams** showing how to structure Django projects at scale
- **Build working code examples** for common patterns (authentication, API design, database optimization)
- **Help optimize** an existing codebase for performance, security, or maintainability
- **Set up deployment configurations** (Docker, AWS, CI/CD pipelines)

Let me know what you're looking to accomplish! 🚀
