# django codebase

I need to clarify your intent. "Django codebase" could mean several different things:

1. **Tutorial/Guide** - You want to learn how to structure a Django project, best practices for organizing code, or understand Django architecture
2. **Starter Template** - You want a ready-to-use Django project scaffold with common setup (database models, views, authentication, API structure)
3. **Specific Feature** - You want code for a particular Django feature (REST API, authentication system, database models, middleware, etc.)
4. **Analysis/Review** - You want help understanding, optimizing, or troubleshooting an existing Django codebase
5. **Migration from Framework** - You want to build Django alongside your existing tech stack (FastAPI, Next.js, AWS) for a specific use case
6. **Full Application** - You want a complete Django application (e.g., task management, blog, e-commerce, admin dashboard)

Given your background with FastAPI and backend development, are you looking to:

- **Compare Django vs FastAPI** for a specific project?
- **Build a production Django API** with modern practices?
- **Integrate Django with your existing stack** (AWS, Docker, Next.js frontend)?
- **Learn Django** as an alternative or complementary framework?
- **Something else entirely?**

Let me know what you're trying to build or accomplish, and I can create the right solution for you!
