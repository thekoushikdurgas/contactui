# give me now full file structure with best practices and full power of django and python

I've completely expanded the Django guide with **full production file structure** and **6 complete code patterns** showing enterprise-ready practices:

**What's new:**

1. **Complete file tree** - 50+ files organized by responsibility
2. **Base settings** - Multi-environment, Redis, Celery, JWT, DRF config
3. **Service layer** - UserService, AuthService with transactions
4. **ORM patterns** - Custom managers, querysets, indexes
5. **DRF ViewSets** - With filtering, pagination, custom actions
6. **Celery tasks** - Async processing with retries and scheduling
7. **Pytest fixtures** - Factories, authenticated clients, integration tests

This follows industry standards used at [djavue3](https://github.com/evolutio/djavue3) and [cookiecutter-django-enterprise](https://github.com/CFBruna/cookiecutter-django-enterprise) templates.

**Next steps:** Want me to generate actual starter code files you can copy-paste, or focus on specific patterns (Docker setup, CI/CD, AWS deployment)?
